## Proxy Server for NSS Front-End Capstone

This is a proxy server I built to access the [Google Places Web Service API](https://developers.google.com/places/) for my front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/BlaiseRoberts/proxy-server/blob/master/server.js)!
